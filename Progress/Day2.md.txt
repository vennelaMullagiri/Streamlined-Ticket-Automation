📅 Day 2 Progress – Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations
Overview

On Day 2, we moved from the foundation phase into automation and flow implementation. This milestone automated ticket assignment to the appropriate group based on the issue type, reducing manual work and improving resolution speed.
